In *July 2016*, Someone called **Tom Elvis Jedusor** (Voldemort's French name in [J.K. Rowling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._K._Rowling)'s [Harry Potter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter) book series) placed the original **MimbleWimble** white paper on a bitcoin research channel, and then disappeared.

Tom's white paper "Mimblewimble" (a tongue-tying curse used in "[The Deathly Hallows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows)") was a blockchain proposal that could theoretically increase privacy, scalability and fungibility. 

At the end of 2016, **Ignotus Peverell** (name also came from "Harry Potter", the original owner of the invisibility cloak, if you know the Harry Potter characters) started a Github project called **Grin**, and began turning the MimbleWimble paper into something real.

**[Andrew Poelstra](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-poelstra-958a75106)**, a mathematician at Blockstream, presented on this work in January 2017 at Stanford University's Blockchain Protocol Analysis and Security Engineering 2017 conference. And he wrote a 2nd [MilbleWimble paper](https://download.wpsoftware.net/bitcoin/wizardry/mimblewimble.pdf), made precise Tom's original idea, and added further scaling improvements on it.

And in March 2017, Ignotus Peverell posted a technical [[introduction|Introduction]] to MimbleWimble and Grin on Github. 

That's the interesting story of MimbleWimble/Grin origin.
