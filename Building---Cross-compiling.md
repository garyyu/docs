It should be fairly easy and cheap to build and run a validating node everywhere (wherever Rust can run). That being said, it is possible to cross-compile `grin` on a x86 Linux platform and produce ARM binaries, for example, in order to run on a Raspberry Pi. You will need to use the `milestone/testnet1` branch and uncomment the `no-plugin-build` feature as documented [below](#cuckoo-miner-considerations) to avoid compiling and running the mining plugins.

If you have any issues with native cross-compilation in your host system, you can try using Docker and [rust-on-raspberry-docker](https://github.com/kargakis/rust-on-raspberry-docker).
