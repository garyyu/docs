Currently, *a new grin is emitted every second*, and it's likely to stay that way forever, meaning that the supply stays rate stays constant. Why? Consider the following points.

## It's very close to Bitcoin in the first decade

Bitcoin had a full reward for 4 years, followed by half that for the following 4 years. So compared to a constant supply, after 8 years, the total amount of coins emitted is only 25% less. Compare that to daily price fluctuations.

## It's even more similar to Ethereum

Ethereum's reward stayed at 5 ether per block until late 2017. It then changed to 3 ether per block, with no plan for another modification.

## New supply falls below 10% after 10 years

Every year that passes makes the overall dilution smaller. After 10 years, this falls below 10%. After 20, below 5%.

## It's highly likely that at least 2% of coins get lost per year

Multiple studies have shown that a considerable amount of coins get lost, burnt and generally disappear from circulation with no chance to get them back. The rate at which coins get lost has been conservatively estimated at 2%, but is likely slightly higher. 

## Tail emission is required for long term stability

Miners need incentives to secure the chain beyond only fees.

## There are already better store of values or "get rich quick" coins

Grin is privacy and scalability focused. Its qualities are better utilized as a medium of exchange, than as a store of value.

## It will get forked into a "get rich quick" coin

Fine. But the keyword in "get rich quick" is _quick_. Moderate yearly variations in supply are fairly slow in comparison.
